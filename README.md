Food Wheel
A web application that helps users find nearby restaurants and randomly select one using an interactive spinning wheel. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages the Google Places API to search for restaurants based on user-entered cuisine keywords (e.g., "Japanese restaurant") and a customizable radius (500â€“5000 meters). The app displays up to 20 restaurants, allows users to select up to 10 for the wheel, and features a D3.js-powered wheel that spins clockwise (minimum 3 rotations) to choose a restaurant, with results shown in a modal including Google Maps directions. A draft wheel with 10 placeholder options is shown on load or if no results are found.
